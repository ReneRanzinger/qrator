Qrator is a web-based application designed to assist researchers in curating glycan structures.  The complexity of glycans makes determining which structures have errors a tedious and labor-intensive process. To help alleviate this, Qrator features a two-stage review process, and allows researchers to view literature and database references, user annotations, and canonical structure trees to help them make informed decisions when curating glycans.  We currently support N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipids.
